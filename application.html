        <p>Frameworks for consideration.
        </p>
        <p>It's important to bear in mind that a move towards <em>any</em> of the frameworks below will require infrastructure changes to support it, as well as changes to the codebase to support modern modular Javascript. All of them work with NPM & Webpack. Without this initial legwork, we cannot move.</p>
        <p>Sizing up exactly which of these frameworks is the right fit for us is a tricky endevour, and I'd really require more dedicated time to evaluate exactly which is the winner.</p>

                    <br>One major barrier might be that Angular uses Typescript natively, meaning a pretty steep new learning curve on top of architecture refactoring.

                    <br>It could transpire that Vue.js may not be powerful enough to deliver our applicaitons needs. I would need to look at some real-world equivalents of fucntionality to find out.
