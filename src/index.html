        <p>
            We require a fully portable, practical and modern update to our current Front-End infrastructure. </p>
        <p>
            Important elements of our system architecture including environments and base packages are antiquated and/or unsupported. They also do not offer the benefits of modern systems/packages that could streamline our development processes in a multitude of ways. A shift towards a more modern and mature architecture would allow us to leverage these benefits and more.</p>
        <p>An attractive toolset and contemporary methodology would also assist with resourcing on the FE.</p>
        <p>At a macro-scale, this would likely mean moving away from Scale Factory as our SysOps provider, leaving us with the option to either find another — more reliable — provider, or 'go it alone' and manage systems in-house. The former could be expensive, and the latter would need to be a well monitored and automated solution and would potentially require resourcing. From a Front-End perspective, a updated infrastructure would allow us to use modern, reliable and supported packages and frameworks. This would improve system stability, application speed and reduce complexity.</p>
        <p>The process would have to be done iteratively, so it's important that library choices are based on their ability to integrate with our current framework. Pros and cons of all frameworks, including Angular 2+ should be considered.</p>
